This repository contains two Python scripts developed during the CodeClause Internship.

## Calculator

The Calculator script is a simple command-line calculator program. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input two numbers and select the desired operation, and the program will display the result.


## Password Generator

The Password Generator script generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria. It allows users to specify the length of the password and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated password is displayed on the screen.

Feel free to explore and use these scripts in your Python projects.
